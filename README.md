The code reads data from five different days that experienced lake effect snow in northern Minnesota, calculating:
  
  1000 to 700mb and 1000 to 500mb Thickness
  
  0 to 1 km, 0 to 3 km, and 0 to 6 km lapse rate
  
  Humidity averages over the sounding.



The resulting data is written to the output file "output_final_project_Moore.txt"
